# Solving small code problems  
* 20 - 45 minutes
* typical solutions: 10-40 LOC (lines of code)
* used extensively in interviews for a reason
  * mastery on a language
  * logic / reasoning
  * communication skill
* not a skill that you "aquire and file away", but needs a lot of practice

------------------  

### Understand the Problem (most important)
* there are requirements that are explicit
  * take notes - refigure in your own words, perhaps outline form
  * make sure all requirements are in your refiguring 
  * the odd words problem
* requirements are not so explicit and need to be modeled
  * requirements are showed with examples
    * examples need to be described in computational terms
    * for instance diamond of stars
  * implicit (implied but not plainly expressed) knowledge needs to be captured
    * convert to explicit rules, in computational language
  * identify and define important terms and concepts

* ask questions to verify my understanding!  

#### Examples / Test Cases

* Test cases serve two purposes:
