### Goals of Ruby lessons:
------
* Build fluency in Ruby
* learn to think like a programmer
* learn to build applications
* adopt a debugging mindset

------

### Three main buckets:
* Learning to program procedurally
* OOP - learning to think in an Object Orientated way
* Other:
  *  testing
  * blocks
  * tools
  * problem solving
  * developing familiarity with the language

------

### Learning to Code vs Learning to Program
* first, Ruby grammar & syntax (English grammar/vocabulary)
* second, building applications (writing essays/novels)
* very frustrating jump between the two
* pseudo code; using plain english to map out the code
