### Goals of Ruby lessons:
------
* Build fluency in Ruby
* learn to think like a programmer
* learn to build applications
* adopt a debugging mindset

------

### Three main buckets:
* Learning to program procedurally
* OOP - learning to think in an Object Orientated way
* Other:
  *  testing
  * blocks
  * tools
  * problem solving
  * developing familiarity with the language

------

### Learning to Code vs Learning to Program
* first, Ruby grammar & syntax (English grammar/vocabulary)
* second, building applications (writing essays/novels)
* very frustrating jump between the two (doing a lot of syntax lookup)
* pseudo code; using plain english to map out the code

------

### Looking for help
* Search using the "right phrases"
  * use the stack trace
  * read error messages, pay attention to these
  * adding "ruby"
* Stack Overflow
* Ruby docs
  * not Rails docs

------

### Asking for help
* treat LS TA's like co-workers
  * Tell of everything that you tried
* push everything to Github
* forums, make use of frequently
  * Tell of everything that you tried
*  
------

### LS is training me for Application Development
* There are lots of different types of programming
* Ruby syntax is good for all kinds of programming
